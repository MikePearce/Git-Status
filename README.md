# Get Status

Ever wanted to get the status of repos in multiple sub directories? Yeah, me 
too. So I knocked this up.

Note: for a similar take on this problem, see [uncommitted](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/uncommitted)

## Installation

Copy the file to `/usr/bin`(or `/usr/sbin`)

```bash
cp show_status /usr/bin
```

Give it execute permissions

```bash
chmod +x /usr/bin/show_status
```

## Usage

Usage: `show_status [options]`

Show Status is awesome. If you tell it a directory to look in, it'll scan
through all the sub dirs looking for a .git directory. When it finds one it'll
look to see if there are any changes and let you know. It can also push and
pull to/from a remote location (like github.com) (but only if there are no
changes.) Contact mike@mikepearce.net for any support.

```
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIRNAME, --dir=DIRNAME
                        The directory to parse sub dirs from
  -v, --verbose         Show the full detail of git status
  -r REMOTE, --remote=REMOTE
                        Push to the master (remotename:branchname)
  -p PULL, --pull=PULL  Pull from the master (remotename:branchname)
```
